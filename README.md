# LCBO-beer-scraper
A simple python script to get information on beers from the LCBO website and save as CSV
Scrape gets the data 1000 entries at a time and saves to .json files, while data.py compiles it to CSV, data.py will break if LCBO exceeds 2000 entries in the beer category, but can probably be easily fixed/futureproofed.
